Personal Project: Fraud Detection in Credit Card Transactions

I'm excited to share my personal project on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions to prevent financial losses and protect customers. ðŸš€

Objective: Detect fraudulent credit card transactions to prevent financial losses and protect customers.

Steps Involved:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: I used a dataset of credit card transactions and addressed the data imbalance issue using SMOTE and other techniques.

Handling Imbalanced Data: I applied oversampling and undersampling techniques to ensure a balanced dataset.

Feature Engineering: I created new features to capture transaction patterns and applied scaling and normalization techniques.

Model Building: I tested several models, including:

Logistic Regression: 89.0% accuracy score
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): 95.0% accuracy score
Support Vector Classifier (SVC): 95.0% accuracy score
Decision Tree Classifier: 84.0% accuracy score
Model Evaluation: I evaluated the models using metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and AUC-ROC, with a focus on minimizing false negatives.

Implementation: I implemented a real-time transaction monitoring system that flags suspicious activities. Additionally, I developed a system for ongoing model updates and retraining to ensure the model remains accurate and effective over time.

This project was a great opportunity for me to apply my skills in machine learning and data science to a real-world problem. I'm proud to say that my models achieved high accuracy scores, with KNN and SVC performing the best.

we have our best set models trained using gridsearch now we move onto testing them on different metrices so as to know which one works best overall for us.

svc : The Support Vector Classifier (SVC) with a regularization parameter C=0.5 performed the best. LogisticRegrestion :The Logistic Regression model with a regularization parameter C=0.001 performed second best tree_clf : The Decision Tree Classifier with a maximum depth of 2 and a minimum of 5 samples per leaf node performed third best. KNeighborsClassifier : The K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier with 2 neighbors performed the worst add these informations in last
